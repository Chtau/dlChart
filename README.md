# dlChart

Lightweight Angular Chart Library.

The goal of this Library is to have an easy to use and small in size Chart Library.
It perfect for the usage in a Dashboard or somewhere where you can't / won't lazy load a Chart Library.

The Charts are created with SVG which makes them responsive for every screen resolution and have no extern Library Dependencies.
